        <h1>Some Information About Me...</h1>  
        <p>I was born on May 17, 2004 in New Jersey. I moved to the Pittsburgh area early in my life, and I have been here ever since. 
          I am the daughter of Egyptian immigrants and have close ties to my Egyptian roots. I would describe myself as someone who is easygoing and friendly
          I am currently studying Information Science at the <span style="color: blue">University</span> of <span style="color: gold">Pittsburgh</span>. Last summer, I completed a software engineering internship at PNC, 
          and the summer before that, I studied abroad in Sydney, Australia. Look below to see me on some of my adventures, 
          and explore the tabs on this website to learn more about my favorite things!</p>
